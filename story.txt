	Glenn was heading to his reunion, driving down the empty highway when we began to grow tired. As he rolled down his window, the smell from the countryside reminded him of his past. It took him back to that night at the hotel when his entire life changed.
		Glenn says out loud the hotel name, Hotel California. He remembers it being such a lovely place, and specifically recalls the time where he requested his favorite wine and they were out of it.At the time, this made Glenn momentarily sad, but there was much else to this hotel to be enjoyed.
