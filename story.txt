	Glenn was heading to his reunion, driving down the empty highway 
		when we began to grow tired. As he rolled down his 
		window, the smell from the countryside reminded him of 
		his past. It took him back to that night at the hotel 
		when his entire life changed. Glenn says out loud the 
		hotel name, Hotel California. He remembers it being such 
		a lovely place, and specifically recalls the time where 
		he requested his favorite wine and they were out of 
		it.At the time, this made Glenn momentarily sad, but 
		there was much else to this hotel to be enjoyed. This 
		was back in the early seventies. Glenn liked playing 
		music with his friends. He played guitar at that point 
		and was on tour as part of the backup band for Linda. It 
		was at that hotel with some of the other guys that they 
		decided to start their own band.
