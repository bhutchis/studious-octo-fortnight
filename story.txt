	Glenn was heading to his reunion, driving down the empty highway 
		when we began to grow tired. As he rolled down his 
		window, the smell from the countryside reminded him of 
		his past. It took him back to that night at the hotel 
		when his entire life changed. Glenn says out loud the 
		hotel name, Hotel California. He remembers it being such 
		a lovely place, and specifically recalls the time where 
		he requested his favorite wine and they were out of 
		it.At the time, this made Glenn momentarily sad, but 
		there was much else to this hotel to be enjoyed. This 
		was back in the early seventies. Glenn liked playing 
		music with his friends. He played guitar at that point 
		and was on tour as part of the backup band for Linda. It 
		was at that hotel with some of the other guys that they 
		decided to start their own band. 
	Little did Glenn know at the time that his career was about to take off. He was no longer playing someone else's music, being told what to do. When they started that band, their spirits were restored as they were free; creatively liberated to pursue their own albums and play their own gigs. Glenn and his bandmates took the scary road of leaving their careers to pursue music, and while everyone in their lives advised them not to throw their lives away, they knew that this was right for them and it paid off.
	Now, those doubters don't doubt their decision. Glenn and his bandmates had their share of highs and lows over the years but they all paid off. The Eagles are one of the most successful bands of all time and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
